#Neighborly

Neighborly is a web application that allows people to connect to find help right in their
own back yard.  Users can create 'requests' that outline a project or task that they need
assistance with.  Other users can view this request and make an 'offer' to help.  There is
no transfer of currency for services, just the transfer of time credits.

A time credit is earned for ever hour a user spends helping another with their request.
Once a person helps with a request, the agreed upon time credit is transferred from the
requesting user to the offering user. This helps create a stronger community allowing
people put their skills to use to get help in return.  

Neighborly is built on the Ruby (2.3.0) language, Ruby on Rails framework, postgresql database, and the Activerecord ORM.

Getting Started

Below are the steps to get Neighborly running locally.

First, clone this repository to your local machine. Here is console input to
clone utilizing SSH.

```
git clone git@github.com:kylelaughlin/community-service-bartering.git
```

The “Getting Started” section outlines the process of getting the app installed and usable for a developer. I define ‘usable’ in this context as able to login to the application and access all of the functionality available.

Information you might want to include is:

A detailed spin-up process. This should include:
Instructions on installing any software the application is dependent on: e.g.: wkhtmltopdf, PostgreSQL, XQuartz.
Instructions on running the app. For rails apps you’ll want to include the rake db:create db:migrate db:seed process here, as well as instructions on starting a server (e.g. are we using pow, or just the default `rails s`)
A list of credentials that can be used to log in with each user type in the system and ideally the URL that a developer can log in from.
Any information about subdomains in the app (e.g.: api.myapp.dev/)
When writing instructions pretend you’re writing them for someone who knows next to nothing about developing in the framework/language your application uses.

== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
